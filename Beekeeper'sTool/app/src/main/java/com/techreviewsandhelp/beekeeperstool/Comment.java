     * This class is made to only have notes in. This class won't be used for anything else.
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * Ideas
     * 1. Ability to sync from a cloud service like DropBox
     *
     * 2. An ability to select which hive to take notes on with an NFC, 3d barcode, and maybe something else.
     *
     * 3. An ability to make reminders and calendar events.
     *
     * 4. An ability to find YouTube how to videos (if we make some)
     *
     * 5. An ability to take voice notes voice activation (maybe best to add something that says best used with mic)
     *       have the nfc working with the voice notes, so the app says which hive the user was talking about.
     *
     * 6. An ability to use some of the sensors on a major brand phone. EX UV, heat, etc
     *
     *

/**
 * Voice notes should have the ability to save to the name of the hive, and the time.
 * It maybe a good idea to have them auto save to the cloud.
