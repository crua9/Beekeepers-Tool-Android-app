     * This class is made to only have notes in. This class won't be used for anything else.
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * Ideas
     * 1. Ability to sync from a cloud service like DropBox. This maybe useful when it comes to saving old files. I'm not sure how big the historic files can get.
     * This also maybe useful when it comes to voice notes
     *
     * 2. An ability to select which hive to take notes on with an NFC, 3d barcode, and maybe something else.
     *
     * 3. An ability to make reminders and calendar events.
     *
     * 4. An ability to find YouTube how to videos (if we make some)
     *
     * 5. An ability to take voice notes voice activation (maybe best to add something that says best used with mic)
     *       have the nfc working with the voice notes, so the app says which hive the user was talking about.
     *
     * 6. An ability to use some of the sensors on a major brand phone. EX UV, heat, etc
     *
     * 7. Add an ability to backup and restore. (or auto backup)
     *
     * 8. Have the phone ask simple questions by audio that will fill out the hives. (I don't think most people will actually review their notes
     * So it maybe better to have the phone ask a simple yes or no question (do you see honey? Is there a queen?). Then the phone
     * can ask the user to review the question when the list is done. The phone will then read off everything, and that away the user doesn't have to look at their phone.
     *
     * On top of this, the user should have the ability to say hold on (or something like that) and the phone will go in standby while the user is looking for the answer. When
     * the user wants the phone to listen again, they would have to say something like "listen to me".
     *
     * There also needs to be the ability to skip questions and come back to it as needed. This includes skipping entire hives.
     * Maybe there is a way to give the user an ability to select what hive they want to mess with based on the number. I don't know how this will work in a dynamic mode.
     *
     * At the end, the phone needs to ask the user if they want to take voice notes. But how do you turn off this and go back to the voice Q&A without touching anything?)
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * To Do
     *
     *
     *
     * 1. Pest page needs pictures and links. (something needs to be done with the wasted space on the layout)
     *
     * 2. Hive page needs to be turned into a dynamic list.
     *
     * 3. Voice class needs to be made. This function needs to all the user to take notes, and answer yes or no questions about a hive.
     * (some of the questions are on the a_hive layout)
     *
     * 4. Front page needs to be more eye candy. This can be worked on last.
     *
     * 5. A list needs to be made whenever someone adds a new hive. Maybe this list can be added to by the user?
     *
     * 6. The save function needs to be worked on. This function needs to save all data to outside of the app for backup reasons. Also, this needs to do something with older files so it doesn't
     * clog the phone. Maybe send all data off to a cloud. The app can then force this, if it can't then it will warn the user every time they use this that it needs to be connected so it can
     * delete old files.
     * How old should be too old? Maybe ask a company?
     * Is there something we can do with those files for computer use?
     * Maybe this can be sync to Google cloud.
     *
     * 7. Ads and donation.
     * May add a feature where someone can donate, get a code, and they don't get ads or ask to donate again? Legal?
     * Will the person donate or stand it if the voice ask them? (Maybe not)
     *
     * 8. Take off the place holder and fully release the app.
     *
     * 9. If the person has outside instruments like temp, humidify, LB, etc. then it can be tied into the log.
     *
     * 10. Add a voice control button on the notification bar. That away someone just has to hit the button, to turn on the vc.

/**
 * Voice notes should have the ability to save to the name of the hive, and the time.
 * It maybe a good idea to have them auto save to the cloud.
 */


    /**
     * it maybe a good idea to have the hive selection dynamic. For now, the saved feature needs to be saving outside of the app.
